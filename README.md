Sound Vision is a project where I use 2 USB webcams and Javascript in the browser to produce feedback for the blind. 
https://imgur.com/a/I6yFuLA is an image of my 2 USB webcams, however eventually these will be smaller and mounted to glasses (endoscope cameras for example). The sound is 3d positional sound. 
It runs 30 or 60 fps depending on the camera. In the source is a 'testing' boolean switch, so you can play with the 3d algorithm wihtout 2 webcams. 
You can try it out on https://www.kchatty.com/soundvision and a terrible video of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaS3z-DCmGM . Note you need to run it online because of the CORS policies.
